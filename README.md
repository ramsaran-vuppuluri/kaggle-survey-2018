# kaggle-survey-2018

Kaggle has initiated an industry-wide survey in 2017 that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. In 2018, the study was live for one week in October and had collected responses from 23,859 individuals.

I have utilized Kaggle survey data to write a blog post "State of Data Science and Machine Learning."

I have divided survey questions into 5 sections and analyzed the responses in each of these sections.

1. Geographical location of the respondents
2. Age & Gender
3. Coding and Machine Learning experience.
